## 🚀 About CureLedger

CureLedger serves as infrastructure for health data marketplaces, enabling seamless coordination across chains and platforms. This repository is part of a larger vision to accelerate decentralized healthcare innovation while maintaining rigorous compliance with global standards.

Here, you'll find open-source components critical to CureLedger's functionality, including:

- **$DSCI Token**: An ERC20 utility token facilitating cross-chain transactions and data integrity.
- **Cypher Module**: Advanced cryptographic operations for ensuring privacy and security.

### 🌐 Interface with CureLedger

Developers can connect and build on CureLedger using our **RPC/API endpoints**. These endpoints allow seamless integration of external decentralized applications (dApps) with CureLedger. Access the API documentation [here](https://api.cureledger.org).

## 🛠️ High-Level Architecture

CureLedger's technical foundation includes the following components:

1. **Three Core Endpoints**: These endpoints provide essential services, enabling data submission, query, and transaction validation across the CureLedger ecosystem.
   - **Data Submission API**: For securely uploading and verifying health data.
   - **Data Query API**: For retrieving and interacting with marketplace data.
   - **Transaction API**: For coordinating token transfers and on-chain operations.

2. **Compliance Back End**: Ensures all transactions and data processes align with global regulatory standards, supporting decentralized compliance management.

3. **ERC20 Utility Token ($DSCI)**: Facilitates cross-chain operations, binds transactions to the CureLedger network, and enables seamless interactions between dApps and the marketplace.
